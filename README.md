# TrickyStatusEffects 

A plugin which helps to implement status effects in your prototype.

## Installation

The plugin can be used in both C++ and Blueprint projects.

### Blueprint projects

1. Download the latest [**package file**](https://github.com/TrickyFatCat/TrickyStatusEffects/releases);
2. Install the plugin either in your project or for all projects in engine:
   * Unzip the package into Plugins folder of your project, e.g. `D:\UnrealProjects\MyProject\Plugins`;
   * Unzip the package to the Plugins folder in engine folder, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0\Engine\Plugins`;
3. Restart the project;

### C++ projects

1. Create the Plugins folder in the project directory;
2. Create the TrickyAnimationComponents folder in the Plugins folder;
3. Download the plugin source code into that folder;
4. Rebuild the project;

## Other Plugins

You can find other plugins on my [**itch.io**](https://tricky-fat-cat.itch.io/tricky-prototyping-collection);

## Content

The plugin contains:

1. StatusEffect object;
2. StatusEffectsManagerComponent;
3. StatusEffectsLibrary;

### StatusEffect object

A simple object which encapsulates status effect logic.

Use this object to create your status effects.

#### Variables

By default it has one variable `StatusEffectData`, this structure contains:

1. `Instigator` - the actor which applied the status effect;
2. `TargetActor` - the target actor of the status effect;
3. `OwningManager` - status effects manager component which owns the status effect;
4. `EffectType` - determines status effect type;
   1. `Positive`
   2. `Negative`
   3. `Neutral`
5. `EffectUniqueness` - determines how many instances of the status effect can be created:
   1. `Normal` - no limits;
   2. `PerInstigator` - instigator can apply only one status effect of this class on a target;
   3. `PerTarget` - only one status effect of this class can be applied to the target;
6. `IsInfinite` - toggles if the status effect has infinite duration or not;
7. `Duration` - duration of the effect;
8. `DurationTimerHandle` - a duration timer handle of the status effect;
9. `DurationReActivationBehavior` - determines how the duration will be recalculated when the status effect was reapplied.
   1. `None` - no changes;
   2. `Custom` - by default do nothing, but can be overriden;
   3. `Reset` - reset the timer;
   4. `Add` - add duration to the remaining time;
10. `IsStackable` - toggles if the status effect can be stacked;
11. `MaxStacks` - maximum amount of stacks;
12. `InitialStacks` - initial amount of stacks;
13. `CurrentStacks` - current amount of stacks;
14. `StacksReActivationBehavior` - determines how current stacks will be recalculated when the status effect was reapplied.
    1. `None` - no changes;
    2. `Custom` - by default do nothing, but can be overriden;
    3. `Reset` - reset the current stacks to initial value;
    4. `Add` - add delta stacks to current stacks;
15. `DeltaStacks` - amount of stacks added per re-activation;

8. `GetRemainingTime` - returns remaining time if `IsInfinite` == false, else -1;
9. `GetElapsedTime` - returns elapsed time if `IsInfinite` = false, else -1;
10. `IsStackable` - returns if the status effect is stackable;
11. `GetMaxStacks` - returns maximum amount of stacks;
12. `GetCurrentStacks` - returns current amount of stacks;
13. `AddStacks` - increases the number of stacks;
14. `RemoveStacks` - decreases the number of stacks;
